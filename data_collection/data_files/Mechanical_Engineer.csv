Our market entry is the growing California ADU (accessory dwelling unit) market, where small and beautiful is big and valuable.
Who We’re Looking For
We seek a sharp, technical, and detail-oriented design engineer to help develop the next generation of high-end, practical living spaces at our workshop in San Francisco. This person will work directly with architects, structural engineers, general contractors, and fabricators, synthesizing their various points of view into a coherent design solution that is fully captured in 3D CAD (Onshape). A proven track record of creating beautiful, high-quality mechanical assemblies is a must. Careful parametric model planning upfront is also needed to enable the efficient creation of design permutations. Finally, a passion for detailed documentation to capture and communicate design intent is highly desirable.",-1,Periscope Homes,"San Francisco, CA",-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
