Vision To Learn is a non-profit organization that provides free eye exams and free glasses to students in low-income communities to give them every chance to succeed in school and in life. The program was founded in Los Angeles in 2012 and has since expanded to schools throughout areas of California, Delaware, Hawaii, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, Georgia, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania. 80% of all learning during a child’s first 12 years is obtained through vision and is consequently one of the most basic problems standing in the way of educational achievement. Since our inception, Vision To Learn examined over 285,000 students and provided over 227,000 children with free glasses. Vision To Learn partners with school districts to provide eye exams to children living in underserved communities with unmet needs for glasses.
