We approach fighting addiction as a team sport and provide each member with a care team that works together to ensure our members receive comprehensive, coordinated care. Our outpatient model is designed to fit into our member’s schedules so they can keep working and living a normal life.

We approach fighting addiction as a team sport and provide each member with a care team that works together to ensure our members receive comprehensive, coordinated care. Our outpatient model is designed to fit into our member’s schedules so they can keep working and living a normal life.

Groups Recover Together was founded in 2014 to make treatment for opioid addiction respectful, accessible and affordable. We empower our members to regain control of their lives through a combination of community support, outpatient weekly group therapy and medication to manage withdrawal using buprenorphine and naltrexone.

What differentiates Groups is the belief that long-term recovery from opioids is tied to aspects of life that are beyond the reach of traditional medical care. We approach fighting addiction as a team sport and provide each member with a care team that works together to ensure our members receive comprehensive, coordinated care. Our outpatient model is designed to fit into our member’s schedules so they can keep working and living a normal life. As a result, our outcomes reflect the success of our model and the commitment of our members with 74% remaining in treatment after 6 months, 90% attending group therapy each week and 89% abstaining from illicit substances each week.

Groups Recover Together was founded in 2014 to make treatment for opioid addiction respectful, accessible and affordable. We empower our members to regain control of their lives through a combination of community support, outpatient weekly group therapy and medication to manage withdrawal using buprenorphine and naltrexone.

What differentiates Groups is the belief that long-term recovery from opioids is tied to aspects of life that are beyond the reach of traditional medical care. We approach fighting addiction as a team sport and provide each member with a care team that works together to ensure our members receive comprehensive, coordinated care. Our outpatient model is designed to fit into our member’s schedules so they can keep working and living a normal life. As a result, our outcomes reflect the success of our model and the commitment of our members with 74% remaining in treatment after 6 months, 90% attending group therapy each week and 89% abstaining from illicit substances each week.

Groups Recover Together was founded in 2014 to make treatment for opioid addiction respectful, accessible and affordable. We empower our members to regain control of their lives through a combination of community support, outpatient weekly group therapy and medication to manage withdrawal using buprenorphine and naltrexone.

What differentiates Groups is the belief that long-term recovery from opioids is tied to aspects of life that are beyond the reach of traditional medical care. We approach fighting addiction as a team sport and provide each member with a care team that works together to ensure our members receive comprehensive, coordinated care. Our outpatient model is designed to fit into our member’s schedules so they can keep working and living a normal life. As a result, our outcomes reflect the success of our model and the commitment of our members with 74% remaining in treatment after 6 months, 90% attending group therapy each week and 89% abstaining from illicit substances each week.

We empower our members to regain control of their lives through a combination of community support, outpatient weekly group therapy and medication to manage withdrawal using buprenorphine and naltrexone.

What differentiates Groups is the belief that long-term recovery from opioids is tied to aspects of life that are beyond the reach of traditional medical care. We approach fighting addiction as a team sport and provide each member with a care team that works together to ensure our members receive comprehensive, coordinated care. Our outpatient model is designed to fit into our member’s schedules so they can keep working and living a normal life. As a result, our outcomes reflect the success of our model and the commitment of our members with 74% remaining in treatment after 6 months, 90% attending group therapy each week and 89% abstaining from illicit substances each week.
