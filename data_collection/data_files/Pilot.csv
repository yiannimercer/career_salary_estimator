Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

F-35C Lightning
F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet
EA-18G Growler
E-6B Mercury
E-2C Hawkeye
C-2 Greyhound
MH-60R Seahawk
MH-60S Knighthawk
MH-53 Sea Stallion
P-3C/EP-3E Orion
P-8A Poseidon

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

F-35C Lightning
F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Amazon Prime Air is seeking a Drone Operator with sound judgment and strict flight discipline. Success will require attention to detail, a safety-oriented attitude, flexibility, and enthusiasm for drone technology. The ideal candidate is someone who enjoys working in a fast-paced environment and can deliver results under pressure.

We are looking for a candidate who has aviation experience as well as familiarity with the principles of Developmental Flight Test. Experience with a Part 107 certification is beneficial. This candidate will be expected to conduct flight test operations as a crew member and advise decision-makers as described in CFR Part 91, 107, & 135. This individual will also conduct flight readiness activities and operational planning as required. Aviation Safety experience is highly preferred.

Key job responsibilities
Drone Operators support Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) of drone aircraft and Ground Support Equipment (GSE), continually pursue end-to-end process improvement, and are critical to the program’s test efforts in pursuit of 30-minute customer delivery operations with autonomously safe air vehicles. These roles include tasks that require a thorough understanding and adherence to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations during the daily execution of flight test operations. Drone Operators perform the last physical aspects of test vehicle preparation and final inspections before operations in the public sphere and monitor vehicles (via visual, audio, and electronic recording means) to help verify nominal flight characteristics and to identify developing off-nominal conditions. Accordingly, Drone Operators are trained to detect hazards and manage associated risks, as well as respond appropriately to potential emergency situations. They approach operations in accordance with their training, Prime Air policy / Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and local/state/federal law.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

F-35C Lightning
F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet
EA-18G Growler
E-6B Mercury
E-2C Hawkeye
C-2 Greyhound
MH-60R Seahawk

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

F-35C Lightning
F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet
EA-18G Growler
E-6B Mercury
E-2C Hawkeye

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training.

After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Amazon Prime Air is seeking a Drone Operator with sound judgment and strict flight discipline. Success will require attention to detail, a safety-oriented attitude, flexibility, and enthusiasm for drone technology. The ideal candidate is someone who enjoys working in a fast-paced environment and can deliver results under pressure.

We are looking for a candidate who has aviation experience as well as familiarity with the principles of Developmental Flight Test. Experience with a Part 107 certification is beneficial.

Key job responsibilities
Drone Operators support Developmental Test and Evaluation (DT&E) of drone aircraft and Ground Support Equipment (GSE), continually pursue end-to-end process improvement, and are critical to the program’s test efforts in pursuit of 30-minute customer delivery operations with autonomously safe air vehicles. These roles include tasks that require a thorough understanding and adherence to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations during the daily execution of flight test operations. Drone Operators perform the last physical aspects of test vehicle preparation and final inspections before operations in the public sphere and monitor vehicles (via visual, audio, and electronic recording means) to help verify nominal flight characteristics and to identify developing off-nominal conditions. Accordingly, Drone Operators are trained to detect hazards and manage associated risks, as well as respond appropriately to potential emergency situations. They approach operations in accordance with their training, Prime Air policy / Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and local/state/federal law. Baseline training to accomplish these flight-related tasks includes developing knowledge of industry standards (e.g., Federal Aviation Regulations Part 91, 107 and 135), Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) safety procedures (e.g., first aid and basic firefighting), Federal Communications Commission (FCC) radio communication standards, and Hazardous Materials (HAZMAT) control regulations.

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Advance your training as you continue to proudly fly for your country in the Navy Reserve. You may fly and train on:

F/A-18 Hornet and Super Hornet

E-6B Mercury
E-2C Hawkeye

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training. The final phase is advanced naval flight training, focusing on mission specifics. After completion, Pilots and NFOs are awarded their “wings of gold” and report to their respective Fleet Replacement Squadrons (FRSs) for further training specific to their aircraft.

Promotion opportunities are regularly available but competitive and based on performance. It’s also important to note that specialized training received and work experience gained in the course of service can lead to valuable credentialing and occupational opportunities in related fields.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Most of what you do in the Navy Reserve is considered training. The basic Navy Reserve commitment involves training a minimum of one weekend a month (referred to as drilling) and two weeks a year (referred to as Annual Training) – or the equivalent of that.

Aviators in the Navy Reserve serve in an Officer role. Your prior experience as an Officer satisfies the initial leadership training requirement – so you will not need to go through Officer Training again.

Work Environment
As a Navy Pilot or an NFO, missions and assignments can be anywhere around the globe. This includes working from carrier battle groups, or other sea-based platforms, and at Naval Air Stations or other locations on shore.

Currently, this position in the Navy Reserve is open only to prior or current military aviators and Naval Flight Officers.

Serving part-time as a Reservist, your duties will be carried out during your scheduled drilling and training periods. During monthly drilling, Navy Pilots and Naval Flight Officers in the Navy Reserve typically work at a location close to their homes.

For Annual Training, Naval Aviators may serve anywhere in the world, whether on a ship at sea or at bases or Naval Air Stations on shore.

Take a moment to learn more about the general roles and responsibilities of Reservists.

Training & Advancement
Those entering aviation programs must first attend Officer Candidate School (OCS) in Newport, R.I., and then complete a six-week air indoctrination course at Naval Aviation Schools Command, in Pensacola, Fla. From there, prospective Pilots and NFOs attend primary flight training.

Pilots and NFOs then request an aircraft pipeline and enter the intermediate phase of flight training, which builds upon basic flight and navigation training.
