The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.",-1,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD",Unknown,-1,Government,Federal Agencies,Government,Unknown / Non-Applicable

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.",-1,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD",Unknown,-1,Government,Federal Agencies,,Unknown / Non-Applicable

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.",-1,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD",Unknown,-1,Government,Federal Agencies,Government,Unknown / Non-Applicable

365,Mathematician,,"NSA Overview The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect our nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.",-1,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD",Unknown,-1,Government,Federal Agencies,Government,Unknown / Non-Applicable

394,Mathematician,$73K - $91K (Employer est.),"NSA Overview The professionals at the National Security Agency (NSA) have one common goal: to protect our nation. The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.",-1,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD",Unknown,-1,Government,Federal Agencies,Government,Unknown / Non-Applicable

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.",-1,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD",Unknown,-1,Government,Federal Agencies,Government,Unknown / Non-Applicable

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.",-1,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD",Unknown,-1,Government,Federal Agencies,Government,Unknown / Non-Applicable

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.",-1,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD",Unknown,-1,Government,Federal Agencies,Government,Unknown / Non-Applicable

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.",-1,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD",Unknown,-1,Government,Federal Agencies,Government,Unknown / Non-Applicable

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.",-1,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD",Unknown,-1,Government,Federal Agencies,Government,Unknown / Non-Applicable

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions. While there is no specific requirement for any previous programming or computing experience, a mathematician must be willing to learn to use computers effectively.",-1,National Security Agency,"Fort Meade, MD",Unknown,-1,Government,Federal Agencies,Government,Unknown / Non-Applicable

The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.

The mission requires a strong offense and a steadfast defense. The offense collects, processes, and disseminates intelligence information derived from foreign signals for intelligence and counterintelligence purposes. The defense prevents adversaries from gaining access to sensitive classified national security information. At NSA, mathematics is a core discipline and is present in every aspect of the mission. Mathematicians bring a wealth of expertise including, but not limited to, number theory, finite field theory, coding theory, Fourier analysis, graph theory, probability, and statistics. They work on some of the hardest problems associated with signals intelligence (the interception, collection, and analysis of foreign signals) and information security (assuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information). Mathematicians have the opportunity to learn and experiment in areas far from their academic training. These opportunities and core mission needs help make NSA the largest employer of mathematicians in the country. Description of Position NSA is actively seeking mathematicians to join a vibrant community of mathematicians, statisticians, physicists, computer scientists, and other intelligence professionals. Newly-hired mathematicians begin their careers in the Mathematics Development Program (MDP). The goal of the three-year MDP is to train mathematicians to be broadly knowledgeable in the spectrum of mathematical sciences used at NSA. To accomplish this goal, MDP members study cryptologic mathematics and related subjects in Agency taught classes and complete 6-month tours in diverse NSA offices. Graduates of the MDP may choose their first permanent assignments from any of the NSA Directorates, depending on availability. The Agency is unique in its ability to offer the opportunity to work in diverse areas of Applied Mathematics. In addition to cryptologic mathematics, mathematicians work in: - Signals analysis - Data compression - Machine learning - Data science - Human language technology - Speech/image/video processing - Analysis of communication networks - Network vulnerability analysis - Cybersecurity Additionally, computing is an essential component of mathematics at NSA and mathematicians must use a variety of computing platforms to test ideas and implement solutions.
