In order to interpret communications, an Interpreter performs many different tasks.

Translate Verbal Communications
The bulk of an Interpreters' job is to translate verbal communications, usually in real-time. This can include speeches at conferences and events, meetings, classes and training sessions, or individual communications between two people or small groups of people. It is crucial that they interpret accurately and quickly in real-time without leaving out or changing any information that is being communicated.

Translate Written Communications
Interpreters also translate written communications. These can include anything from documents and forms to meeting notes to emails to presentations. It’s important that they effectively communicate the meaning of the text and maintain its core message.

Assist Clients
Acting as a liaison between two parties, the interpreters facilitate communications by assisting clients on behalf of their company. This can include helping them understand documents and information given out by the company, assisting them in filling out forms and paperwork, and answering questions or addressing concerns on behalf of the client. They must also maintain a knowledge of the clients’ culture and be aware of any culturally sensitive issues that may arise.

Record Interactions
The Interpreter is often required to document and record interactions and translations. They record their interactions by entering data into a system, and that information is then used for various statistical reporting purposes. This includes recording in-person interactions as well as phone conversations and taking meeting minutes.

Interpreting Skills
Since communication is the job of an Interpreter, they must have fantastic communication abilities, verbal and written, in both of the languages, they will be using. They are personable and have great relationship-building skills, allowing them to effectively communicate and build relationships with both parties. Empathy and an awareness of other cultures are also crucial to being a successful Interpreter.
