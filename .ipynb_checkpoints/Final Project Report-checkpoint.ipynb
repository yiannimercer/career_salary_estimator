    "U.S. News presented a list of the [Top 100 Careers in 2021](https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/rankings/the-100-best-jobs), which featured many relatively new and exciting options like Data Scientist and Software Enginner, but also old-reliable one's like Accountant or Physician. This project aimed to find a relationship between the average salary of the *Top 50* Careers from the former list and numerous variables that would be found on a respective job posting. When these relationship were identified, we exploited the underlying patterns that drive salary in order to develop a regression model that can accurately predict the average salary of various career paths.  Upon arriving at an optimized, well performing model, we developed a web application that can ingest a user's inputted data, and return our model's average salary predicition. "

    "The top 50 careers according to U.S. News seemed to use a rather ambiguous method of ranking these careers.  However, the scope of our project was not concerned with the actual true ranking of these careers, especially considering the career choice can be such an opinionated matter.  Regardless, it is important to note we are utilizing the former list to drive our data collection process.  In other words, we ingested the first 50 *unique* careers (*unique* ~ in the matter of ties), and did no analysis of their ranking method.  \n",

    "[Glassdoor.com](https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm) is a worldwide leading platform for individuals to review companies and provide data regarding their experience and role at a company, and for companies to post job soliciations with the hope of hiring quality candidates.  Glasdoor offers unprecendented insights into the employee experience powered by millions of company ratings and reviews, CEO approval ratings, salary reports, interview reviews and questions, benefits reviews, and much more.  Utilzing [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/), and a [web scraper designed for glassdoor](https://github.com/arapfaik/scraping-glassdoor-selenium) from nearly three years ago, we were able to ingest nearly 50,000 records of data.  Specifically, we scraped 1,000 job postings for each of the careers in our list.  Below you can see the web scraping function being imported and called to scrape Glassdoor for five job postings that are related to the search term, 'Data Scientist'.  The function returns a pandas Data Frame that houses the five scraped job postings.  "

The former method was the efficient and robust to the code breaking at any point.  There were instances where the for-loop broke due to unforseen events.
